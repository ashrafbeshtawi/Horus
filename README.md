# Horus - Personal Portfolio

## Project Overview

Horus is my personal portfolio project, designed to showcase my skills and expertise as a developer. It is built using a combination of technologies, including:

- Frontend: Nuxt.js (a Vue.js framework) and Three.js for 3D and interactive elements
- Backend: Symfony (a PHP framework) for the API and server-side logic
- Database: PostgreSQL

The project's name, "Horus," is a reference to the ancient Egyptian god of the sky, which aligns with the project's focus on visual and interactive elements.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive 3D Environment**: The project features a 3D landscape with various elements, including buildings, trees, and animals, all created using Three.js. Users can explore this environment and interact with different elements.

2. **Portfolio Presentation**: The project serves as a platform to showcase my work, skills, and experiences as a developer. It includes sections for showcasing projects, displaying technical skills, and providing information about my background.

3. **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.

4. **API-driven Backend**: The Symfony-based backend powers the API that feeds data to the frontend, providing a scalable and maintainable architecture.

5. **PostgreSQL Database**: The project utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data, ensuring secure and reliable data handling.
